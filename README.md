# Twitts for Python 3

This is an little script for accessing the twitter api for storing your tweets in an database, and selecting them for deletion on the platform.

This script was intentionally written for cleaning up my twitter account, while keeping a copy of my tweets in an database.
I did not want to delete all my old tweets so I provided the flag `delete_next` for setting tweets that should be deleted in future.
